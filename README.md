# The Ultimate Heist
##A Drawing On The Web Final Project
The idea behind this project is to capture the experience of a heist movie’s prototypical sections as moments trapped in time. From my extensive viewing of such films, I believe they exist of four core scenes:

1.	The introduction
2.	The heist
3.	The escape
4.	The aftermath/betrayal

The index of the project will be lain out as an HTML canvas styled to look like either a black board or a whiteboard, with the other three portions scrawled onto it as SVG drawing connected by arrows to show the flow of the action. A diamond would represent the heist, a car representing the escape, and a briefcase to represent the aftermath.

The heist itself would be captured by a three.js world. The camera is in a room with the centerpiece of said room being a pedestal. On this pedestal, a gem that shines brightly slowly rotates. Around the gem, red lasers flicker in and out of existence, showing the tight security surrounding it and how difficult it is to steal. I’ll have to disable some of the controls like zooming or figure out how to surround the player in a box so that I can simulate the room the diamond is in, but currently the prototype is just the pedestal and the jewel with a couple lasers.

The escape is another three.js world. It is an endlessly looping highway at night time, with the fact that the viewer is moving down the road being shown through the lane lines moving down and street lamps moving as well. I would also add a faint blue and red pulsing effect to symbolize the police chase, as well as having siren and car noises in the background as sound.
The Aftermath/betrayal sequence consists solely of a 3D model of a briefcase with an image of a diamond on it, representing its contents. By clicking on it, the viewer can open it and reveal that it is empty except for a note. This represents the twist betrayal ending many such films have. For this to be impactful. The opening animation will be drawn out, with clasps being opened and perhaps even a combination being entered.
