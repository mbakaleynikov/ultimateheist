      For my midterm project, I wanted to create a top-down stealth game that revolves around the players robbing a bank using a team of two robbers.
  The game would be tile-based, with a tile either being empty, a wall, or an obstacle
  Each of the two robbers has their own particular skillset which will be  uselful in overcoming the levels.
  The game will take place in one bank, which will be a series of rooms filled with various obstacles.
  The obstacles include robotic patrolling guards, security cameras, locked doors, and tripwires.
  The players must make it to the vault, get the moeny, and then get out without being caught.
  They have a limited amount of time to complete the game before the shifts change and they are caught.
  Each of the two robbers will have a set of consumable items, unique to them. This will include items such as mirrors(to stop lasers), bombs(to stop gurads or quickly open doors), and single use keycards.
  The difficulty chosen at the beginning will determine the amount of items you spawn with.
  Any obstacle can be cirumvented without them, but it will be significantly harder(i.e avoiding a guard with stealth vs knocking him out), or there may be a penalty imposed on the player (i.e hitting a laser makes the timer speed up)
  <p></p>
  Player 1 is a master thief. He can open a locked door much faster than player 1, and can also listen at doors to reveal guards and defenses on the other side. He can also
  Player 2 is a hacker. He has the ability to cloak himself from the guise of cameras and robots, as well as an ability to deactivate them at a distcane using an emp(which has lmmited uses)
  Both players can deactivate defenses by directly interacting with them, although breaking this may take a while and ending it early will asurredly speed up the timer.

  Once they have circumvented all the challenges, the players can either both take half the loot and escape together, or betray each other.
  This will be done very simply, with each player choosing either betray or work together. If one betrays and the other doesn't the traitor gets the money. If both betray, they lose. If neither betrays, they each get half.

  Why do we want to build such a game?
  One of my favorite co-op experiences was a game called Monaco, about 4 robbers breaking into a place to rob it. Each has different special abilities that allwo the group to make it through undetected and unscathed.
  I combined this concept with a flash game I played in the late 2000s, called Bank Robber. During my childhood, this was one of the games I played the most, and I still find it an enjoyable,
  if singularly flawed, experience. I thought it would be really cool to be able to play such a game in co-op with a partner, but also retain a source of underlying tension beneath that partnership.
